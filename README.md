Survey App

The Project aims to build an Android App for online survay.


Survey Owner:
Defines scope and question content for survey. Reviews prototype survey prior to live deployment. For example, 
the hotel owner who wants guest feedback on hotel quality. Or a university department that wants feedback on 
its modules and courses .

Survey Participant:
Participates in surveys. Provides information that is collated to form survey results. Survey participant data should be
anonymous in a deployed survey. For example, hotel guests who should provide information about their visit. Or a student 
who wants to provide module feedback on the bus while travelling home from campus

Site Administrator:
Creates and deletes survey owners. An administrator working on behalf of the survey service company
